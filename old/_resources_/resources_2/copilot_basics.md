# SQL Basics

## SQL Syntax Rules

1. **Case Insensitivity**:
   - SQL keywords are case-insensitive. For example, `SELECT`, `select`, and `SeLeCt` are all equivalent.
   - However, case sensitivity for table names, column names, and other identifiers depends on the database system and its configuration.

2. **Statements and Clauses**:
   - SQL statements are composed of clauses, which are typically written on separate lines for readability.
   - Each statement ends with a semicolon (`;`).

3. **Whitespace**:
   - SQL ignores extra whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines). You can format your SQL code for readability without affecting its execution.

4. **Comments**:
   - Single-line comments start with `--` and continue to the end of the line.
   - Multi-line comments are enclosed in `/*` and `*/`.

5. **Identifiers**:
   - Identifiers (such as table names and column names) can be enclosed in double quotes (`"`) or square brackets (`[]`) to handle special characters or reserved words.
   - Identifiers should start with a letter and can include letters, digits, and underscores (`_`).

6. **Literals**:
   - String literals are enclosed in single quotes (`'`).
   - Numeric literals do not require quotes.

7. **Functions and Expressions**:
   - Functions are called with parentheses, e.g., `COUNT(*)`.
   - Expressions can include operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

8. **Joins**:
   - SQL supports various types of joins, including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.

9. **Subqueries**:
   - Subqueries are enclosed in parentheses and can be used in various clauses like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING`.

10. **Order of Execution**:
    - The typical order of execution for a SQL query is:
      1. `FROM`
      2. `WHERE`
      3. `GROUP BY`
      4. `HAVING`
      5. `SELECT`
      6. `ORDER BY`
      7. `LIMIT` (if applicable)

## SQL Data Types

SQL supports a variety of data types to handle different kinds of data. These data types can be broadly categorized into numeric, character, date and time, and binary data types.

### Numeric Data Types
Numeric data types are used to store numerical values.

- **INT:** Integer data type.
- **SMALLINT:** Smaller range integer.
- **BIGINT:** Larger range integer.
- **DECIMAL(p, s):** Fixed-point number with precision `p` and scale `s`.
- **NUMERIC(p, s):** Similar to `DECIMAL`.
- **FLOAT:** Floating-point number.
- **REAL:** Single precision floating-point number.
- **DOUBLE PRECISION:** Double precision floating-point number.

  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example_table (
      int_column INT,
      smallint_column SMALLINT,
      bigint_column BIGINT,
      decimal_column DECIMAL(10, 2),
      numeric_column NUMERIC(10, 2),
      float_column FLOAT,
      real_column REAL,
      double_column DOUBLE PRECISION
  );
  ```

### Character Data Types
Character data types are used to store text.

- **CHAR(n):** Fixed-length character data.
- **VARCHAR(n):** Variable-length character data.
- **TEXT:** Variable-length character data with unlimited length.

  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example_table (
      char_column CHAR(10),
      varchar_column VARCHAR(50),
      text_column TEXT
  );
  ```

### Date and Time Data Types
Date and time data types are used to store dates and times.

- **DATE:** Stores date values (year, month, day).
- **TIME:** Stores time values (hour, minute, second).
- **TIMESTAMP:** Stores date and time values.
- **INTERVAL:** Stores a period of time.

  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example_table (
      date_column DATE,
      time_column TIME,
      timestamp_column TIMESTAMP,
      interval_column INTERVAL

  ```

### Binary Data Types
Binary data types are used to store binary data.

- **BINARY(n):** Fixed-length binary data.
- **VARBINARY(n):** Variable-length binary data.
- **BLOB:** Binary Large Object.

  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example_table (
      binary_column BINARY(10),
      varbinary_column VARBINARY(50),
      blob_column BLOB
  );
  ```

### Key Points to Remember

## SQL Functions

SQL functions are built-in routines that perform operations on data and return a value. They can be categorized into different types based on their functionality, such as aggregate functions, scalar functions, and more. Understanding these functions is essential for effective data manipulation and analysis.

### 1. Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single value. They are commonly used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause.

- `COUNT()`: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
- `SUM()`: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
- `AVG()`: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
- `MIN()`: Returns the smallest value in a set.
- `MAX()`: Returns the largest value in a set.

### 2. Scalar Functions

Scalar functions operate on a single value and return a single value. They can be used for string manipulation, date calculations, and mathematical operations.

- String Functions

  - `UPPER()`: Converts a string to uppercase.
  - `LOWER()`: Converts a string to lowercase.
  - `SUBSTRING()`: Extracts a substring from a string.
  - `LENGTH()`: Returns the length of a string.

- Date Functions

  - `NOW()`: Returns the current date and time.
  - `CURDATE()`: Returns the current date.
  - `DATEDIFF()`: Returns the difference between two dates.

- Mathematical Functions

  - `ROUND()`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
  - `FLOOR()`: Returns the largest integer value less than or equal to a number.
  - `CEIL()`: Returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to a number.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```sql
  -- String Functions
  SELECT function_name(column_name) AS alias_name FROM table_name;
  SELECT function_name(column_name, additional_parameters) AS alias_name FROM table_name;

  -- Date Functions
  SELECT function_name() AS alias_name;
  SELECT function_name(date1, date2) AS alias_name FROM table_name;

  -- Mathematical Functions
  SELECT function_name(column_name) AS alias_name FROM table_name;
  SELECT function_name(column_name, additional_parameters) AS alias_name FROM table_name;
  ```


### 3. Conditional Functions

Conditional functions evaluate conditions and return specific values based on the evaluation.

- `IF()`: Returns one value if a condition is true and another value if it is false.
- `CASE`: A more complex conditional function that allows multiple conditions to be evaluated.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name,
    IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false) AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

SELECT column_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN condition1 THEN result1
        WHEN condition2 THEN result2
        ELSE result_else
    END AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

## Clauses in SQL
SQL clauses are components of SQL statements that specify the conditions, operations, and instructions for retrieving or manipulating data. Understanding these clauses is crucial for writing effective SQL queries.

### Clauses:

1. **SELECT Clause**
   - The SELECT clause is used to specify which columns of data to retrieve from a table.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
     ```

2. **FROM Clause**
   - The FROM clause specifies the tables from which to retrieve the data.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1 FROM table_name;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Employees;
     ```

3. **WHERE Clause**
   - The WHERE clause filters records based on specified conditions.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30;
     ```

4. **GROUP BY Clause**
   - The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;
     ```

5. **HAVING Clause**
   - The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on a specified condition, often used with the GROUP BY clause.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees GROUP BY Department HAVING AverageSalary > 50000;
     ```

6. **ORDER BY Clause**
   - The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set based on one or more columns.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;
     ```

7. **LIMIT Clause**
   - The LIMIT clause specifies the number of records to return from the result set, useful for pagination.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column1 FROM table_name LIMIT number;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Employees LIMIT 10;
     ```

### Order of Execution: 

```sql
FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY
```

## Joins and Their Types
Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Understanding how to use joins effectively is essential for querying relational databases.

1. **INNER JOIN**
   - The INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1
     INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees
     INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
     ```

2. **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
   - The LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1
     LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees
     LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
     ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
   - The RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1
     RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees
     RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
     ```

4. **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)**
   - The FULL JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table records. Rows that do not have a match will have NULL values for columns from the other table. Note that MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, but you can simulate it using UNION.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1
     FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
     ```

   - **Example (simulated using UNION):**
     ```sql
     SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees
     LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID
     UNION
     SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees
     RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
     ```

5. **CROSS JOIN**
   - The CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning it will return all possible combinations of rows from both tables.

   - **Basic Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns FROM table1
     CROSS JOIN table2;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees
     CROSS JOIN Departments;
     ```

## Sub-queries

A sub-query, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query embedded within another SQL query. Sub-queries can be used in various clauses such as SELECT, WHERE, FROM, and HAVING. They help break complex queries into simpler parts and can return single values, multiple values, or even tables.

### Single-row Sub-query
Returns a single value (one row and one column).

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE column1 = (SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees;
```

### Multiple-row Sub-query
Returns multiple rows (one column).

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

### Multiple-column Sub-query
Returns multiple columns.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE (column1, column2) IN (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM (SELECT DepartmentID, Salary FROM Employees) AS DepartmentSalaries
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

### Using Sub-queries in SELECT Statements
Sub-queries can be used in the SELECT clause to derive a value for a specific column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, (SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE condition) AS alias
FROM table1;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees;
```

### Using Sub-queries in WHERE Clauses
Sub-queries are often used in the WHERE clause to filter results based on conditions evaluated by the sub-query.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE column1 = (SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

### Using Sub-queries in FROM Clauses
Sub-queries can be used in the FROM clause to provide a derived table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2 WHERE condition) AS alias;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM (SELECT DepartmentID, Salary FROM Employees) AS DepartmentSalaries
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```

### Using Sub-queries in HAVING Clauses
Sub-queries can also be employed in the HAVING clause to filter groups based on conditions.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*) AS alias
FROM table1
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(column) FROM (SELECT column1, COUNT(*) AS alias FROM table2 GROUP BY column1) AS alias);
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(EmployeeCount) FROM (SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID) AS DeptCount);
```

### Correlated Sub-queries
A correlated sub-query refers to a sub-query that uses values from the outer query. It is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1 alias1
WHERE column1 > (SELECT AVG(column) FROM table2 alias2 WHERE alias1.column = alias2.column);
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, Salary
FROM Employees e1
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e1.DepartmentID = e2.DepartmentID);
```

## Views 

A view is a virtual table in SQL that is based on the result-set of a SELECT query. Views do not store data themselves but display data stored in other tables. They can simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access to specific data, and provide a level of abstraction.

### Creating a View
To create a view, use the `CREATE VIEW` statement followed by the view name and the SELECT query that defines the view.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

### Querying a View
Once a view is created, you can query it just like a regular table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM view_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeView;
```

### Updating a View
To update an existing view, use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

### Dropping a View
To remove a view, use the `DROP VIEW` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
DROP VIEW EmployeeView;
```

### Advantages of Using Views
- **Simplification:** Simplifies complex queries by encapsulating them in a view.
- **Security:** Restricts access to specific data by exposing only the necessary columns and rows.
- **Consistency:** Provides a consistent, unchanging interface to the underlying data, even if the underlying table structures change.
- **Reusability:** Allows reuse of complex queries without rewriting them.

### Limitations of Views
- **Performance:** Views can sometimes impact performance, especially if they are based on complex queries or large datasets.
- **Updatability:** Not all views are updatable. Views based on multiple tables or complex joins may not support INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.
- **Dependency:** Changes to the underlying tables can affect the view, potentially causing it to break or return incorrect results.

### Updatable Views
Some views can be updated directly, but there are restrictions. For a view to be updatable, it must:
- Reference only one table.
- Include all NOT NULL columns in the SELECT statement.
- Not use aggregate functions, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, UNION, or sub-queries.

**Example of an Updatable View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW SimpleEmployeeView AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees;
```

**Updating the View:**
```sql
UPDATE SimpleEmployeeView
SET FirstName = 'John'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
``` 

## Indexes

An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It works like an index in a book, allowing the database to find data without scanning every row.

### Creating an Index
To create an index, use the `CREATE INDEX` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
```

### Using Indexes
Indexes are automatically used by the database optimizer when executing queries that involve the indexed columns.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
```

### Dropping an Index
To remove an index, use the `DROP INDEX` command.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
DROP INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees;
```

### Types of Indexes
- **Unique Index:** Ensures that all values in the indexed column are unique.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
  ```

  **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON Employees (Email);
  ```

- **Composite Index:** An index on multiple columns.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
  ```

  **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_composite ON Employees (LastName, FirstName);
  ```

- **Full-text Index:** Used for full-text searches on string columns.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
  ```

  **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_fulltext ON Articles (Content);
  ```

### Preparation Notes for Interviews

## Triggers

A trigger is a database object that is automatically executed or fired when certain events occur. Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, validate data, and maintain audit trails.

### Creating a Trigger
To create a trigger, use the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- trigger logic
END;
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
END;
```

### Using Triggers
Triggers are automatically invoked by the database when the specified event occurs on the associated table.

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName) VALUES ('John', 'Doe');
```

### Dropping a Trigger
To remove a trigger, use the `DROP TRIGGER` command.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
DROP TRIGGER before_employee_insert;
```

### Types of Triggers
- **BEFORE Trigger:** Executes before the triggering event.
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_update
  BEFORE UPDATE ON Employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
      SET NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  END;
  ```

- **AFTER Trigger:** Executes after the triggering event.
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_delete
  AFTER DELETE ON Employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
      INSERT INTO EmployeeAudit (EmployeeID, Action, ActionTime)
      VALUES (OLD.EmployeeID, 'DELETE', NOW());
  END;
  ```

- **Effective Use:** Understanding how to use triggers effectively can help enforce business rules and maintain data integrity.

## Cursors in ANSI SQL using MySQL

A cursor is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through a result set row by row. Cursors are useful for processing individual rows returned by a query.

### Declaring a Cursor
To declare a cursor, use the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement within a stored procedure or a block of code.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
DECLARE employee_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

### Opening a Cursor
To open a cursor, use the `OPEN` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
OPEN cursor_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
OPEN employee_cursor;
```

### Fetching Data from a Cursor
To fetch data from a cursor, use the `FETCH` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
FETCH cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2, ...;
```

**Example:**
```sql
FETCH employee_cursor INTO @emp_id, @first_name, @last_name;
```

### Closing a Cursor
To close a cursor, use the `CLOSE` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CLOSE cursor_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
CLOSE employee_cursor;
```

### Example of Using a Cursor
Here is a complete example of using a cursor within a stored procedure:

**Example:**
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE process_active_employees()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE emp_id INT;
    DECLARE first_name VARCHAR(50);
    DECLARE last_name VARCHAR(50);
    
    DECLARE employee_cursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Status = 'Active';
    
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = 1;
    
    OPEN employee_cursor;
    
    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH employee_cursor INTO emp_id, first_name, last_name;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Process each row
        INSERT INTO EmployeeAudit (EmployeeID, Action, ActionTime)
        VALUES (emp_id, 'PROCESSED', NOW());
    END LOOP;
    
    CLOSE employee_cursor;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

## PL/SQL Overview

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. It combines the data manipulation power of SQL with the processing power of procedural languages.

### Key Features of PL/SQL
- **Block Structure:** PL/SQL code is organized into blocks, which can be nested. Each block has a declarative part, an executable part, and an exception-handling part.
- **Procedural Constructs:** Supports loops, conditionals, and exception handling.
- **Tight Integration with SQL:** Allows SQL statements to be embedded within procedural code.
- **Error Handling:** Provides robust error handling with exceptions.
- **Portability:** PL/SQL code can run on any Oracle database.

### Basic PL/SQL Block Structure
A PL/SQL block consists of three sections: the declarative section, the executable section, and the exception-handling section.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE
    -- Declarative section: variables, constants, cursors, etc.
BEGIN
    -- Executable section: procedural and SQL statements
EXCEPTION
    -- Exception-handling section: error handling code
END;
/
```

### PL/SQL Constructs
- **Variables and Constants:** Used to store data.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DECLARE
      variable_name datatype;
      constant_name CONSTANT datatype := value;
  BEGIN
      -- Code to use variables and constants
  END;
  /
  ```
- **Control Structures:** Includes IF statements, loops (FOR, WHILE, and simple loops).
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DECLARE
      -- Variable declarations
  BEGIN
      -- FOR loop
      FOR counter IN lower_bound..upper_bound LOOP
          -- Loop body
      END LOOP;
      
      -- WHILE loop
      WHILE condition LOOP
          -- Loop body
      END LOOP;
      
      -- Simple loop
      LOOP
          -- Loop body
          EXIT WHEN condition;
      END LOOP;
      
      -- IF statement
      IF condition THEN
          -- Code to execute if condition is true
      ELSIF another_condition THEN
          -- Code to execute if another_condition is true
      ELSE
          -- Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
      END IF;
  END;
  /
  ```

- **Cursors:** Used to retrieve multiple rows from a query.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  DECLARE
      CURSOR cursor_name IS
          SELECT column1, column2, ...
          FROM table_name
          WHERE condition;
  BEGIN
      OPEN cursor_name;
      LOOP
          FETCH cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2, ...;
          EXIT WHEN cursor_name%NOTFOUND;
          -- Process each row
      END LOOP;
      CLOSE cursor_name;
  END;
  /
  ```

- **Procedures:** Named PL/SQL blocks that perform a specific task.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype) IS
  BEGIN
      -- Procedure body
  EXCEPTION
      -- Exception handling
  END procedure_name;
  /
  ```

- **Functions:** Similar to procedures but return a value.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name (parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype) RETURN return_datatype IS
  BEGIN
      -- Function body
      RETURN value;
  EXCEPTION
      -- Exception handling
  END function_name;
  /
  ```

- **Packages:** Group related procedures, functions, variables, and other PL/SQL constructs.
  **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE package_name IS
      -- Package specification
  END package_name;
  /
  
  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY package_name IS
      -- Package body
  END package_name;
  /
  ```

### Exception Handling 

PL/SQL provides a robust mechanism for handling runtime errors, known as exceptions. Exceptions can be predefined by Oracle or user-defined.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE
    -- Declarative section: variables, constants, cursors, etc.
BEGIN
    -- Executable section: procedural and SQL statements
EXCEPTION
    -- Exception-handling section: error handling code
    WHEN exception_name1 THEN
        -- Code to handle exception_name1
    WHEN exception_name2 THEN
        -- Code to handle exception_name2
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Code to handle all other exceptions
END;
/
```

### Predefined Exceptions
Oracle provides several predefined exceptions that are automatically raised when certain errors occur.

**Common Predefined Exceptions:**
- `NO_DATA_FOUND`: Raised when a SELECT INTO statement returns no rows.
- `TOO_MANY_ROWS`: Raised when a SELECT INTO statement returns more than one row.
- `ZERO_DIVIDE`: Raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.
- `INVALID_CURSOR`: Raised when an illegal cursor operation is attempted.

**Syntax:**
```sql
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
        -- Code to handle no data found
    WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN
        -- Code to handle too many rows
    WHEN ZERO_DIVIDE THEN
        -- Code to handle division by zero
    WHEN INVALID_CURSOR THEN
        -- Code to handle invalid cursor operation
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Code to handle all other exceptions
END;
/
```

### User-Defined Exceptions
You can define your own exceptions in PL/SQL.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE
    user_defined_exception EXCEPTION;
BEGIN
    -- Code that might raise the exception
    IF some_condition THEN
        RAISE user_defined_exception;
    END IF;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN user_defined_exception THEN
        -- Code to handle the user-defined exception
END;
/
```

### Raising Exceptions
You can explicitly raise exceptions using the `RAISE` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DECLARE
    user_defined_exception EXCEPTION;
BEGIN
    -- Code that might raise the exception
    RAISE user_defined_exception;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN user_defined_exception THEN
        -- Code to handle the user-defined exception
END;
/
```

### Retrieving Error Information
You can use the `SQLCODE` and `SQLERRM` functions to retrieve error codes and messages.

**Syntax:**
```sql
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error code: ' || SQLCODE);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error message: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
/
```

### Key Points to Remember
- **Exception Handling:** Essential for robust PL/SQL programs.
- **Predefined Exceptions:** Provided by Oracle for common errors.
- **User-Defined Exceptions:** Allow custom error handling.
- **RAISE Statement:** Used to explicitly raise exceptions.
- **Error Information:** `SQLCODE` and `SQLERRM` functions provide error details.
