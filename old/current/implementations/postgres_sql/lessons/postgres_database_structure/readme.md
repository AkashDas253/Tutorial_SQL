# **Comprehensive Notes on PostgreSQL Database Structure & Internals**  

## **Database Structure**  
 
### **Overview**  
PostgreSQL follows a **multi-level architecture** with databases, schemas, tables, and objects organized efficiently. It supports **ACID compliance** and **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** for handling transactions.  

### **Components of a PostgreSQL Database**  
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Database** | A collection of schemas, tables, views, functions, and other objects. Each PostgreSQL cluster contains multiple databases. |
| **Schema** | A logical namespace within a database that contains tables, views, indexes, sequences, and other objects. The default schema is `public`. |
| **Table** | A structured storage for data consisting of rows and columns. PostgreSQL supports **heap tables** and **partitioned tables**. |
| **Column** | Defines attributes of a table with a specific data type. PostgreSQL supports **JSONB, arrays, and composite types**. |
| **Row (Tuple)** | A single record in a table. PostgreSQL stores tuples with **visibility information** for MVCC. |
| **View** | A virtual table representing the result of a query. Views simplify access to complex queries. |
| **Materialized View** | A persistent snapshot of a query result that requires manual refresh. |
| **Index** | A data structure used to speed up query performance. PostgreSQL supports **B-Tree, Hash, GIN, BRIN, and GiST indexes**. |
| **Sequence** | An object that generates unique numbers, typically used for **auto-incrementing** columns. |
| **Constraint** | Rules enforced on table columns, such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `NOT NULL`. |
| **Functions** | User-defined functions (UDFs) written in PL/pgSQL, C, Python, etc., for extending PostgreSQL capabilities. |
| **Trigger** | A function executed automatically when an event occurs in a table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). |
| **Tablespace** | A storage location where database objects reside. Used for performance tuning. |

## **Internals of PostgreSQL**  

### **1. PostgreSQL Storage Architecture**  
PostgreSQL uses a **heap storage model**, where tables and indexes are stored in **data pages** (blocks) within files.  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Heap Storage** | Stores table data in **fixed-size pages (8KB by default)**. Uses MVCC for managing concurrent transactions. |
| **TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique)** | Handles large values such as text and binary data by compressing and storing them separately. |
| **FSM (Free Space Map)** | Tracks available free space in table pages to reduce fragmentation. |
| **VM (Visibility Map)** | Tracks pages that contain tuples visible to all transactions, speeding up index-only scans. |

---

### **2. Transaction & Concurrency Control (MVCC)**  
PostgreSQL uses **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** to handle concurrent transactions without blocking.  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Tuple Versioning** | Each row (tuple) maintains multiple versions to allow concurrent reads and writes. |
| **Transaction ID (XID)** | Each transaction gets a unique XID that helps determine visibility. |
| **Undo & Vacuuming** | PostgreSQL doesnâ€™t use an undo log; instead, it marks old tuples as **dead** and removes them via `VACUUM`. |
| **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** | Ensures durability by writing changes to a transaction log before committing them to disk. |
| **Autovacuum** | Automatically cleans up dead tuples and reclaims storage to avoid bloat. |

---

### **3. Query Execution Process**  
PostgreSQL optimizes and executes queries using the following steps:  

| Step | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Parsing** | Converts SQL queries into a parse tree using the PostgreSQL parser. |
| **Rewriting** | Applies rules (e.g., view expansion) and transforms the parse tree. |
| **Planning & Optimization** | Generates an execution plan using **cost-based optimization**, choosing the best index scans, joins, and sorting methods. |
| **Execution** | Runs the query using the selected plan and fetches results. |

**Query Optimizer Features**:  
- Cost-based optimizer using **statistics from `pg_statistic`**.  
- Supports **parallel query execution** for performance.  
- Uses **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation** for complex queries.  

---

### **4. Indexing in PostgreSQL**  
Indexes help speed up query performance. PostgreSQL supports multiple indexing strategies:  

| Index Type | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **B-Tree** | Default index type, used for range queries and sorting. |
| **Hash Index** | Optimized for equality-based lookups. |
| **GiST (Generalized Search Tree)** | Used for full-text search and geometric data. |
| **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)** | Optimized for searching within arrays, JSONB, and full-text search. |
| **BRIN (Block Range Index)** | Efficient for large, naturally ordered tables (e.g., logs, timestamps). |

---

### **5. PostgreSQL System Catalogs & Metadata**  
PostgreSQL stores metadata in system catalogs. Important catalogs include:  

| Catalog | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `pg_database` | Lists all databases in the PostgreSQL cluster. |
| `pg_namespace` | Stores schema-related information. |
| `pg_class` | Contains metadata about tables, views, and indexes. |
| `pg_attribute` | Describes columns of tables and views. |
| `pg_stat_activity` | Shows currently running queries and active connections. |

---

### **6. High Availability & Replication**  
PostgreSQL supports replication and clustering for fault tolerance and scalability.  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Streaming Replication** | Provides **synchronous** and **asynchronous** replication to standby servers. |
| **Logical Replication** | Allows **table-level replication** instead of entire databases. |
| **Hot Standby** | Read-only queries can be executed on standby servers. |
| **Connection Pooling** | `pgbouncer` and `pgpool-II` optimize connection handling. |

---

### **7. Partitioning & Sharding**  
PostgreSQL supports **partitioning** to improve performance with large datasets.  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Range Partitioning** | Data is partitioned based on a range of values (e.g., dates). |
| **List Partitioning** | Data is partitioned based on a predefined set of values. |
| **Hash Partitioning** | Data is evenly distributed using a hash function. |
| **Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW)** | Allows PostgreSQL to query external databases (e.g., `postgres_fdw`, `mysql_fdw`). |

---

### **8. Security & User Management**  
PostgreSQL enforces role-based access control (RBAC).  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Roles & Privileges** | Users and groups are managed using `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, and `REVOKE`. |
| **Authentication** | Supports `MD5`, `SCRAM`, `LDAP`, `SSL`, and `Kerberos` authentication. |
| **Row-Level Security (RLS)** | Controls access at the row level using `CREATE POLICY`. |
