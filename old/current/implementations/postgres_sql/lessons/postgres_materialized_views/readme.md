### **PostgreSQL Materialized Views**  
 
#### **Overview**  
A **Materialized View** stores query results physically, unlike a regular view, which computes results on demand. It improves performance by avoiding repeated computation but requires manual or scheduled updates.

---

### **1. Creating a Materialized View**  

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;
```
- Stores aggregated sales data for each region.  
- Data does not update automatically.

---

### **2. Querying a Materialized View**  

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
```
- Retrieves precomputed data instantly.

---

### **3. Refreshing a Materialized View**  

Since materialized views **do not update automatically**, they must be **refreshed** when the base data changes.

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```
- Updates the stored data with fresh query results.

- **With CONCURRENTLY** (avoids table locking):  
  ```sql
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY sales_summary;
  ```
  - Requires a **unique index** on the materialized view.

---

### **4. Updating and Dropping Materialized Views**  

- **Modifying an Existing Materialized View**  
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
  SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY region;
  ```

- **Dropping a Materialized View**  
  ```sql
  DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
  ```

---

### **5. Indexing on Materialized Views**  

- Adding an index improves query performance:  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_sales_summary ON sales_summary(region);
  ```

### **6. Materialized Views vs. Regular Views**  

| Feature | Materialized View | Regular View |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Storage | Stores results | No storage, computed on access |
| Performance | Faster queries | Slower for complex queries |
| Updates | Requires manual refresh | Always up-to-date |
| Indexing | Supports indexes | No indexing |

---

### **7. Use Cases**  

✅ Complex aggregations that do not change frequently.  
✅ Reducing computation load for repeated queries.  
✅ Reporting dashboards and analytics.
