## **PostgreSQL Event Triggers - Comprehensive Cheatsheet**  

---

## **1. Key Concepts**  
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Event Trigger** | A trigger that fires on DDL events (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`). |
| **Trigger Function** | A function executed when the event trigger fires. |
| **DDL Command Execution** | Event triggers run before, after, or during a DDL statement. |
| **System Event Table** | Stores event-related information (`pg_event_trigger`). |

---

## **2. Supported Events**  
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ddl_command_start` | Fires before a DDL command executes. |
| `ddl_command_end` | Fires after a DDL command executes. |
| `sql_drop` | Fires before dropping objects. |
| `table_rewrite` | Fires when a table is rewritten due to `ALTER TABLE`. |

---

## **3. Creating an Event Trigger Function**  
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION log_ddl_commands() RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'DDL command executed: %', tg_event;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
- This function logs DDL commands.

---

## **4. Creating an Event Trigger**  
```sql
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER ddl_logger  
ON ddl_command_end  
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_ddl_commands();
```
- Fires `log_ddl_commands()` after every DDL command.

---

## **5. Listing Event Triggers**  
```sql
SELECT evtname, evtevent, evtowner FROM pg_event_trigger;
```
- Displays registered event triggers.

---

## **6. Dropping an Event Trigger**  
```sql
DROP EVENT TRIGGER ddl_logger;
```
- Removes the trigger.

---

## **7. Disabling an Event Trigger**  
```sql
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER ddl_logger DISABLE;
```
- Temporarily disables the trigger.

---

## **8. Use Cases**  
| Use Case | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auditing** | Log schema changes (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP FUNCTION`). |
| **Security Enforcement** | Restrict unauthorized DDL changes. |
| **Automated Responses** | Auto-adjust dependent objects when schema changes. |
