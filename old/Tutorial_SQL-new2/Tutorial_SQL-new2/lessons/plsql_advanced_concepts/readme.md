## Advanced PL/SQL Concepts

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) is a powerful programming language that integrates SQL with procedural logic to handle complex database operations. In addition to basic constructs, PL/SQL offers advanced features and techniques that allow for more efficient and sophisticated data processing. These advanced concepts include **dynamic SQL**, **collections**, **bulk processing**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **hierarchical queries**, and **advanced exception handling**.

---

### **1. Dynamic SQL**

Dynamic SQL enables the execution of SQL statements that are constructed at runtime. This is useful when the structure of SQL queries is not known in advance or when a query needs to be constructed based on user input.

- **EXECUTE IMMEDIATE**: Used for executing dynamic SQL statements.
- **DBMS_SQL**: A low-level API for executing dynamic SQL.

| **Approach**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`     | Used for simple dynamic SQL execution, such as queries and DML operations.      |
| `DBMS_SQL`               | Provides more control and is used for complex dynamic SQL, including multi-step operations. |

#### **Example**

```plsql
DECLARE
  sql_query VARCHAR2(1000);
BEGIN
  sql_query := 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = :1';
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_query USING 10;
END;
```

### **2. Collections in PL/SQL**

Collections in PL/SQL allow the storage of multiple values in a single variable. The major types of collections are:

| **Type**          | **Description**                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Associative Arrays** | Key-value pair collection, where each element is accessed by a key (index). |
| **Nested Tables**    | Similar to arrays but can store a variable number of elements.                |
| **VARRAYs**          | Fixed-size array of elements of the same data type.                           |

#### **Example of Collection Usage**

```plsql
DECLARE
  TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees.employee_id%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
  emp_ids emp_table;
BEGIN
  emp_ids(1) := 1001;
  emp_ids(2) := 1002;
  FOR idx IN 1..emp_ids.COUNT LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_ids(idx));
  END LOOP;
END;
```

### **3. Bulk Processing**

PL/SQL provides bulk processing mechanisms to handle large amounts of data more efficiently, using the `BULK COLLECT` and `FORALL` statements. These help avoid excessive context switching between SQL and PL/SQL engines, thereby improving performance.

| **Keyword**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BULK COLLECT`   | Fetches multiple rows of data at once into a collection.                       |
| `FORALL`         | Executes a DML operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for all elements in a collection. |

#### **Example of Bulk Collect**

```plsql
DECLARE
  TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees.employee_id%TYPE;
  emp_ids emp_table;
BEGIN
  SELECT employee_id BULK COLLECT INTO emp_ids FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  FOR i IN 1..emp_ids.COUNT LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_ids(i));
  END LOOP;
END;
```

#### **Example of FORALL**

```plsql
DECLARE
  TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees.employee_id%TYPE;
  emp_ids emp_table := emp_table(1001, 1002, 1003);
BEGIN
  FORALL i IN 1..emp_ids.COUNT
    UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE employee_id = emp_ids(i);
  COMMIT;
END;
```

### **4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PL/SQL**

PL/SQL supports object-oriented programming, which allows developers to define and manage complex data structures in a more modular and reusable way. You can define **objects**, **methods**, and **constructors**.

| **Concept**        | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object Types**   | Custom types that encapsulate attributes and methods.                           |
| **Methods**        | Functions and procedures defined within an object type.                        |
| **Constructors**   | Special methods used to initialize object instances.                           |

#### **Example**

```plsql
-- Define an object type
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE employee_obj AS OBJECT (
  employee_id NUMBER,
  first_name  VARCHAR2(50),
  last_name   VARCHAR2(50),
  MEMBER FUNCTION full_name RETURN VARCHAR2
);

-- Define the method of the object
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE BODY employee_obj AS
  MEMBER FUNCTION full_name RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
  BEGIN
    RETURN first_name || ' ' || last_name;
  END full_name;
END;
/

-- Using the object
DECLARE
  emp employee_obj;
BEGIN
  emp := employee_obj(1001, 'John', 'Doe');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp.full_name); -- Output: John Doe
END;
```

### **5. Hierarchical Queries**

PL/SQL allows for querying hierarchical data using the `CONNECT BY` clause, which is useful for dealing with **parent-child** relationships, such as in organizational structures or bill-of-materials data.

| **Keyword**        | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CONNECT BY`       | Specifies the parent-child relationship for hierarchical queries.              |
| `START WITH`       | Defines the root of the hierarchy.                                              |
| `PRIOR`            | Refers to the parent row in hierarchical queries.                               |

#### **Example**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, manager_id
FROM employees
START WITH manager_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
```

### **6. Advanced Exception Handling**

PL/SQL provides advanced exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle errors during runtime. You can use predefined exceptions, user-defined exceptions, and propagate exceptions to higher levels.

| **Type**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Predefined Exceptions** | Built-in exceptions like `NO_DATA_FOUND`, `TOO_MANY_ROWS`, etc.            |
| **User-Defined Exceptions** | Custom exceptions for specific error handling.                              |
| **Exception Propagation**  | Raising an exception to propagate it to the outer block.                     |

#### **Example**

```plsql
DECLARE
  e_not_found EXCEPTION;
  v_emp_id NUMBER := 1001;
BEGIN
  BEGIN
    SELECT employee_id INTO v_emp_id FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1002;
    IF v_emp_id IS NULL THEN
      RAISE e_not_found;
    END IF;
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN e_not_found THEN
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee not found!');
  END;
END;
```

---

### **7. Analytical and Windowing Functions**

PL/SQL supports **analytic functions** that allow for the computation of cumulative, moving averages, or ranking within a partition of data. These functions are particularly useful for reporting and financial applications.

| **Function**        | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()`      | Assigns a unique row number to each row within a partition.                     |
| `RANK()`            | Assigns a rank to each row in a partition, with gaps in rank for ties.         |
| `LEAD()`            | Accesses the next row’s value from the current row within the partition.        |
| `LAG()`             | Accesses the previous row’s value from the current row within the partition.    |

#### **Example**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary, 
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

---

### **8. Autonomous Transactions**

An autonomous transaction is a separate transaction initiated from within another transaction. It is useful for operations like logging or auditing that must complete regardless of the outcome of the main transaction.

| **Keyword**        | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` | Specifies that a block is an autonomous transaction.                       |

#### **Example**

```plsql
DECLARE
  PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO log_table (log_entry) VALUES ('Transaction started');
  COMMIT;
END;
```
