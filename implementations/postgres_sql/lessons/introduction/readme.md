## PostgreSQL â€“ Introduction

### Overview

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its **stability, extensibility, and standards compliance**. It is widely used for both small-scale applications and large, enterprise-level systems. PostgreSQL emphasizes **data integrity, reliability, and performance**, offering advanced features not always found in other relational databases.

### Key Features

* **Open-Source**: Freely available with a permissive license (PostgreSQL License).
* **ACID Compliance**: Ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability for transactions.
* **Extensibility**: Users can define custom data types, functions, operators, and index types.

* **Enterprise/Cloud Editions**: Provided by third-party vendors with additional management and monitoring tools.
* **Versioning**: Active community support with frequent major releases; each version adds new features while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Typical Use Cases

* Enterprise applications requiring complex transactions and high reliability.
* Web applications needing JSON/JSONB storage and queries.
* Geospatial applications using PostGIS.
* Analytics and reporting requiring advanced indexing and SQL features.
* Systems needing high availability and disaster recovery through replication.
