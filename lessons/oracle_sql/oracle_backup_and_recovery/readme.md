## Oracle Backup and Recovery

### 1. **Backup Methods**

Oracle provides two main types of backups: **Logical** and **Physical**. Each serves different purposes and is suitable for various scenarios.

#### 1.1 **Logical Backups (Export/Import)**
A **logical backup** involves backing up the logical structures (tables, schemas, or databases) rather than the physical storage files. The `EXP` and `IMP` utilities are used to perform these backups and restores.

| **Backup Type**       | **Description**                                                 | **Commands**                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Export (EXP)**       | Exports data from an Oracle database into a binary file format. | `EXP username/password FILE=backup.dmp`      |
| **Import (IMP)**       | Imports data from a binary file back into an Oracle database.  | `IMP username/password FILE=backup.dmp`      |
| **Usage**              | Used for backing up and restoring specific objects or entire schemas. Can be done with full database exports or partial schema/table exports. |

##### Example:
```bash
-- Exporting a schema
EXP scott/tiger FILE=scott_backup.dmp SCHEMAS=scott;

-- Importing a schema
IMP scott/tiger FILE=scott_backup.dmp SCHEMAS=scott;
```

- **Advantages:**
  - Fine-grained control (e.g., specific tables, schemas).
  - Easier to move data across databases.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Not suitable for large databases.
  - Slower compared to physical backups.
  - Does not capture all database objects (e.g., logs, datafiles).

#### 1.2 **Physical Backups (RMAN)**
A **physical backup** captures the actual database files (datafiles, control files, redo logs) in their physical format. Oracle provides the **Recovery Manager (RMAN)** tool to automate and manage physical backups.

| **Backup Type**        | **Description**                                                 | **Commands**                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **RMAN Backup**         | A full backup of database files, including datafiles, control files, and redo logs. | `BACKUP DATABASE;`                                |
| **RMAN Incremental**    | Backups only changed blocks since the last backup.             | `BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 DATABASE;`            |
| **Usage**               | Suitable for large databases with minimal downtime. RMAN can be used for automated backups, restoration, and recovery. |

##### Example:
```bash
-- Full backup using RMAN
rman TARGET / BACKUP DATABASE;

-- Incremental backup using RMAN
rman TARGET / BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 DATABASE;
```

- **Advantages:**
  - More efficient for large databases.
  - Supports automatic and incremental backups.
  - Can capture all Oracle-specific files and objects.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires additional storage space and resources.
  - More complex to configure compared to logical backups.

### 2. **Recovery Scenarios**

Oracle provides robust recovery mechanisms to restore a database to a consistent state in the event of failures. There are two primary recovery scenarios: **Instance Recovery** and **Media Recovery**.

#### 2.1 **Instance Recovery**
Instance recovery is triggered automatically when an Oracle database instance crashes or is shut down improperly. During this recovery, Oracle re-applies the necessary redo logs to ensure data consistency.

| **Recovery Type**        | **Description**                                               | **Triggers**                            |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**               | Ensures that the database instance can recover from a crash or unexpected shutdown. The recovery applies pending changes from the redo log files. | Occurs automatically during instance restart after a crash. |
| **Process**               | - Oracle automatically recovers the database using the redo logs. <br> - This involves rolling forward committed transactions and rolling back uncommitted transactions. |

##### Example:
```bash
-- Instance recovery occurs automatically after an unexpected shutdown or crash.
-- Once the database instance is restarted, Oracle automatically performs instance recovery.
```

- **Advantages:**
  - Fully automated.
  - No need for manual intervention.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited to recovery after a crash or abnormal shutdown.
  - Does not address hardware or media failures.

#### 2.2 **Media Recovery**
Media recovery is required when database files are lost or corrupted. Oracle supports **complete** and **incomplete** media recovery. It involves restoring the backup and applying archived redo logs to bring the database up to a consistent state.

| **Recovery Type**        | **Description**                                                 | **Commands**                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Complete Media Recovery** | Involves restoring all necessary backup files (datafiles, control files, archived redo logs) and applying all redo logs to bring the database to a consistent state. | `RECOVER DATABASE USING BACKUP CONTROLFILE;` |
| **Incomplete Media Recovery** | Involves restoring the backup and applying archived redo logs, but without applying all redo logs (useful when a point-in-time recovery is needed). | `RECOVER DATABASE UNTIL TIME 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS';` |

##### Example:
```bash
-- Restoring and recovering the database using RMAN
rman TARGET / RESTORE DATABASE;
rman TARGET / RECOVER DATABASE;
```

- **Advantages:**
  - Can recover from datafile corruption or loss.
  - Flexible with point-in-time recovery.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Manual intervention is required for complete media recovery.
  - Can be more time-consuming compared to instance recovery.
