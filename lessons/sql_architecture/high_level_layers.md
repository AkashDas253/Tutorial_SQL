## **High-Level Layers of SQL Architecture**

### **Client Layer**

* **Purpose**

  * Interface for users or applications to interact with the database.
* **Components**

  * Applications: ERP, CRM, BI tools, web apps
  * Command-line interfaces (CLI)
  * Database drivers & connectors: ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET
* **Responsibilities**

  * Sends SQL queries to the database
  * Receives query results
  * Handles connection management and session settings

---

### **SQL Engine Layer**

* **Purpose**

  * Processes SQL queries and enforces database logic.
* **Components**

  * **Parser**: Validates syntax, generates parse tree
  * **Query Optimizer**: Determines the most efficient execution plan
  * **Query Executor**: Executes the plan, accesses storage
  * **Transaction Manager**: Ensures ACID properties and concurrency control
* **Responsibilities**

  * Parse, optimize, and execute queries
  * Enforce constraints and triggers
  * Manage transactions and concurrency
  * Interface with storage engine

---

### **Storage Layer**

* **Purpose**

  * Manages physical storage of data and indexes.
* **Components**

  * Data files, tables, and partitions
  * Index structures (B-Tree, Hash, GiST)
  * Buffer/cache manager
  * Logs and checkpoints
* **Responsibilities**

  * Efficient data retrieval and storage
  * Maintain indexes for fast query performance
  * Ensure durability via logs and backups
  * Support transactions and recovery mechanisms

---

### **Layer Interaction**

* Client sends SQL query → SQL Engine processes → Storage Layer reads/writes → Result returned to Client
* Optimizer uses metadata/statistics from Storage Layer
* Transaction Manager coordinates locks and logs across Storage Layer
* Buffer pool ensures memory caching between SQL Engine and Storage Layer
