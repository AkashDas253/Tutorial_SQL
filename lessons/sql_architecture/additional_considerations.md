## **Additional Considerations in SQL Architecture**

### **Indexing**

* Improves query performance by reducing data scan.
* Types:

  * **Clustered Index**: Data physically stored in index order
  * **Non-Clustered Index**: Separate structure pointing to rows
  * **Unique Index**: Ensures column values are unique
  * **Composite Index**: Index on multiple columns
  * **Full-text / Specialized Indexes**: For search or geospatial queries
* Considerations:

  * Maintenance overhead during insert/update/delete
  * Covering vs included columns
  * Page splits and fill factor

---

### **Partitioning**

* Divides large tables into smaller segments for efficiency.
* Types:

  * Range, List, Hash, Composite
* Benefits:

  * Faster query pruning
  * Efficient data management and maintenance
  * Can be combined with parallel execution

---

### **Caching & Memory Management**

* **Buffer Pool**: Caches frequently accessed data pages.
* **Temporary Work Areas**: For sorting, aggregations.
* **Memory Spills**: When memory is insufficient, operations may spill to disk.

---

### **Replication & Sharding**

* **Replication**: Copies data across multiple nodes for availability.
* **Sharding**: Splits data horizontally across multiple servers for scalability.
* Considerations:

  * Data consistency and synchronization
  * Query routing to correct shard or replica
  * Load balancing

---

### **Query Plan Caching & Adaptive Execution**

* Frequently used queries can have **cached execution plans** to avoid re-optimization.
* Adaptive query execution may adjust plan based on runtime statistics.

---

### **Triggers & Stored Procedures**

* **Triggers**: Automatic execution on data changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
* **Stored Procedures**: Predefined SQL routines executed by engine.
* Considerations:

  * Can affect performance if overused
  * May interact with transaction management

---

### **Statistics & Metadata Maintenance**

* Up-to-date statistics ensure optimizer chooses efficient plans.
* Histograms and metadata assist in cardinality estimation and selectivity calculations.
* Automatic or manual updates may be required.

---

### **Security Considerations**

* Authentication and authorization.
* Role-based access control.
* Data encryption at rest and in transit.
* Auditing and logging.

---

### **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**

* **Failover mechanisms** for critical systems.
* Backup and recovery strategies.
* Point-in-time recovery using transaction logs.
