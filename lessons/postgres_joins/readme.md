### PostgreSQL Joins  

#### Overview  
Joins in PostgreSQL are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on related columns.

---

### **1. Types of Joins**  

| Join Type | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns matching rows from both tables. |
| **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)** | Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. |
| **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)** | Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. |
| **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)** | Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs where there is no match. |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Returns the Cartesian product of both tables. |
| **SELF JOIN** | Joins a table with itself. |

### **2. INNER JOIN**  
- Returns only matching rows between tables.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### **3. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**  
- Returns all rows from the left table and matches from the right.  
- If no match, NULL is returned for the right table’s columns.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### **4. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**  
- Returns all rows from the right table and matches from the left.  
- If no match, NULL is returned for the left table’s columns.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### **5. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)**  
- Returns all rows from both tables.  
- NULLs appear where there is no match.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### **6. CROSS JOIN**  
- Returns the Cartesian product (all possible combinations) of both tables.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

---

### **7. SELF JOIN**  
- A table joins itself using an alias.  

**Example:** Find employees and their managers:  
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

---

### **8. NATURAL JOIN**  
- Automatically joins tables using columns with the same name.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees NATURAL JOIN departments;
```

---

### **9. USING Clause**  
- Simplifies joins on columns with the same name.  

**Syntax:**  
```sql
SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments USING (department_id);
```

### **10. JOIN Performance Considerations**  

✅ Use indexing on join columns for faster performance.  
✅ Minimize the number of columns selected.  
✅ Avoid unnecessary joins on large tables.
