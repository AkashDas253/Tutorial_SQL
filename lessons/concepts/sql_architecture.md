## **SQL Architecture Overview**

### **High-Level Layers**

* **Client Layer**

  * SQL query submission
  * Applications, BI tools, CLI interfaces
  * Drivers & connectors (ODBC, JDBC)
* **SQL Engine Layer**

  * Core processing of queries
  * Components:

    * Parser
    * Query Optimizer
    * Query Executor
    * Transaction Manager
* **Storage Layer**

  * Physical storage of data
  * Indexes, tables, partitions
  * Buffer management, caching, file management

### **SQL Engine Internal Architecture**

* **Parser**

  * Syntax check & validation
  * Parse tree generation
  * Query decomposition
* **Query Optimizer**

  * Logical optimization

    * Expression simplification
    * Subquery unnesting
    * Predicate pushdown
  * Physical optimization

    * Join strategy selection (Nested Loop, Hash, Merge)
    * Index usage & access path determination
  * Cost estimation & plan selection
* **Query Executor**

  * Executes the optimized plan
  * Accesses storage via storage engine
  * Implements operators: scan, join, aggregation, sort
  * Handles pipelining and materialization
* **Transaction Manager**

  * Ensures ACID properties:

    * Atomicity: Rollback on failure
    * Consistency: Constraints enforcement
    * Isolation: Locking & MVCC
    * Durability: Write-ahead logs
  * Concurrency control & deadlock management
* **Storage Engine**

  * Physical storage & retrieval
  * Data structures: heap, clustered tables
  * Indexes: B-Tree, Hash, GiST
  * Logging, checkpoints, recovery

### **Execution Flow**

1. Client submits SQL query
2. Parser validates & generates parse tree
3. Query Optimizer selects execution plan
4. Executor executes plan
5. Storage engine reads/writes data
6. Transaction manager handles ACID and concurrency
7. Result returned to client

---

### **Key Components Interaction**

* Optimizer uses **statistics & metadata** for plan decisions
* Executor interacts with **buffer pool & storage engine**
* Transaction manager coordinates **logging, locks, MVCC**
* Storage engine provides **persistent storage** and caching

---

### **Additional Considerations**

* **Indexing & partitioning** improve query performance
* **Caching & memory management** reduce I/O overhead
* **Replication & sharding** for distributed databases
* **Query plan caching & adaptive execution** improve repeated query performance
