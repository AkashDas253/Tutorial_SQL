## History of SQL

### Origins of SQL

* **1970 – Relational Model Introduced**

  * E. F. Codd published **“A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks”**.
  * Introduced the **relational database model**, which organized data in tables (relations) using set theory and predicate logic.

* **1973–1974 – SEQUEL Developed at IBM**

  * IBM researchers **Donald D. Chamberlin** and **Raymond F. Boyce** developed **SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language)** at IBM San Jose Research Lab.
  * Designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM’s **System R** relational database.

* **1976 – SEQUEL Renamed to SQL**

  * Name changed to **SQL (Structured Query Language)** due to a trademark dispute with Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company over the name “SEQUEL”.

* **1978 – IBM Released System R Prototype**

  * Implemented SQL, proving relational databases were practical.

### Commercial Adoption

* **1980s – SQL Gains Popularity**

  * IBM, Oracle, and other vendors began adopting SQL for commercial RDBMS products.
  * Oracle released **Oracle V2** in 1979 – first commercially available SQL RDBMS.

* **1986 – ANSI SQL Standard Established**

  * SQL became an **ANSI (American National Standards Institute)** standard.
  * Followed by **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** adoption.

* **1989 – SQL-89 (SQL1)**

  * First formal SQL standard.
  * Basic features: data definition, manipulation, simple queries.

* **1992 – SQL-92 (SQL2)**

  * Major enhancement: added **new data types, integrity constraints, joins, nested queries**, etc.

### Further Evolutions of SQL

* **1999 – SQL:1999 (SQL3)**

  * Object-relational features, triggers, recursive queries, **user-defined types**, **OLAP support**.

* **2003 – SQL:2003**

  * XML integration, **window functions**, better support for **schemas**, and **auto-generated values**.

* **2006 – SQL:2006**

  * Extended XML support, enhanced **XML querying and storage** in relational tables.

* **2008 – SQL:2008**

  * Added **TRUNCATE**, **MERGE**, and more precise control over **datetime** types.

* **2011 – SQL:2011**

  * Support for **temporal databases** (time-based data), improving audit and time tracking.

* **2016 – SQL:2016**

  * Enhanced JSON support, **row pattern matching**, **polymorphic table functions**.

* **2019 – SQL:2019**

  * Minor revisions, mostly clarifications, and bug fixes from earlier versions.

### Modern Relevance

* SQL remains the **de facto standard for relational database management**.
* Widely used in systems like **PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle**, etc.
* Extensions and dialects exist, but all share a SQL core.
