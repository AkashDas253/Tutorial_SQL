## ANSI SQL Views

A **view** in SQL is a virtual table that is based on the result of a query. Views do not store data physically but provide a way to access and query data from one or more tables in a simplified or customized manner. They can simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access to certain data, and improve query efficiency.

### Types of Views

| **View Type**         | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                       |  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Simple View**       | A view based on a single table without any complex operations.                   | `CREATE VIEW simple_view AS SELECT * FROM employees;`             |  
| **Complex View**      | A view based on multiple tables, involving joins, subqueries, or aggregations.   | `CREATE VIEW complex_view AS SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;` |  
| **Inline View**       | A view that is not stored in the database but used directly in a query.          | `SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 2) AS dept_employees;` |  
| **Updatable View**    | A view that allows users to perform DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the underlying base tables. | `CREATE VIEW updatable_view AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 2;` |  
| **Materialized View** | A view that stores the result set physically in the database for improved performance on repeated queries (not part of ANSI SQL but widely supported). | `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view AS SELECT * FROM employees;` |

### **Creating a View**

The basic syntax to create a view is as follows:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example**:  
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

---

### **Using Views**

To query data from a view, you can use the `SELECT` statement just like you would query a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_name;
```

**Example**:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_view;
```

---

### **Modifying Data Through Views**

Certain views allow you to insert, update, or delete data in the underlying table(s), depending on the complexity of the view.

#### **Updatable View**
An updatable view is a view that allows modification of data in the underlying base tables. The view must not contain operations like `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, or `JOIN` on more than one table for it to remain updatable.

**Example**:  
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_update_view AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 5;

UPDATE employee_update_view
SET department_id = 6
WHERE first_name = 'John';
```

---

### **Dropping a View**

To remove a view from the database, you can use the `DROP VIEW` statement:

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Example**:  
```sql
DROP VIEW employee_view;
```

---

### **Modifying a View**

You can modify the definition of an existing view using the `CREATE OR REPLACE` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example**:  
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_update_view AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, status
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 5;
```

### **Advantages of Views**

| **Advantage**                | **Description**                                                            |  
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Simplification of Queries** | Views simplify complex queries by encapsulating them in a single object.   |  
| **Security**                  | Views can be used to restrict access to sensitive data by providing limited access to specific columns or rows. |  
| **Data Independence**         | Views provide an abstraction layer, which makes changes to the underlying tables transparent to the user. |  
| **Consistent Data**           | Views ensure consistent results for queries that require the same logic or computation every time. |

### **Disadvantages of Views**

| **Disadvantage**              | **Description**                                                            |  
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Performance Overhead**      | Views that join multiple large tables can have performance overhead since the query is executed every time the view is referenced. |  
| **Limited DML Operations**    | Some views, especially complex ones, may not support data modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). |  
| **Dependency on Base Tables** | Views are dependent on the underlying tables, so any changes to the base tables may affect the view. |

### **Best Practices for Using Views**

| **Best Practice**              | **Description**                                                            |  
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Use Views for Complex Queries** | Views are ideal for simplifying and reusing complex queries, making them easier to maintain. |  
| **Avoid Overuse of Views**      | Overusing views in a database can lead to performance issues, especially if views reference other views or involve complex joins. |  
| **Consider Indexing Views**     | For views that are frequently queried and have complex logic, consider indexing the underlying tables for better performance. |  
| **Keep Views Simple**          | Try to keep views simple and focused on a specific task to avoid complexity and performance degradation. |

### **Conclusion**

ANSI SQL Views are a powerful feature in SQL that help simplify complex queries, enhance security, and provide a layer of abstraction for data retrieval. However, they should be used judiciously, as they can introduce performance overhead, especially for complex queries or when used excessively. Understanding the types of views and their limitations is essential to leveraging their full potential in database design and management.
