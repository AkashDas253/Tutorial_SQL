## Transactions in MySQL

#### Overview
A **transaction** is a set of SQL operations executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure data integrity by ensuring that either all operations within the transaction are successfully completed or none are applied (atomicity). In MySQL, transactions are commonly used with **InnoDB** storage engines, which support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.

#### Key Concepts
- **Atomicity**: Guarantees that all operations within the transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back, and no changes are made.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the database transitions from one valid state to another, adhering to predefined rules, such as constraints and triggers.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that operations of one transaction are isolated from others, preventing conflicts (e.g., reading uncommitted data).
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in case of a system crash.

#### SQL Statements for Transaction Management

| Command         | Description                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `START TRANSACTION` | Begins a new transaction                               |
| `COMMIT`        | Saves all changes made during the current transaction   |
| `ROLLBACK`      | Undoes all changes made during the current transaction  |
| `SAVEPOINT`     | Creates a point within the transaction to which you can roll back |
| `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` | Removes a savepoint from the transaction           |
| `SET TRANSACTION` | Defines the characteristics of a transaction (e.g., isolation level) |

#### Transaction Properties
- **Isolation Levels**: MySQL supports four isolation levels that control how transactions interact with each other:
  - `READ UNCOMMITTED`: Allows dirty reads (reading uncommitted data).
  - `READ COMMITTED`: Ensures no dirty reads, but allows non-repeatable reads.
  - `REPEATABLE READ`: Ensures no dirty or non-repeatable reads (default for InnoDB).
  - `SERIALIZABLE`: Ensures complete isolation, no dirty or non-repeatable reads, and prevents phantom reads.

  You can set the isolation level with:
  ```sql
  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL [LEVEL];
  ```

#### Example of Transaction Usage

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Perform some operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Commit the transaction to save changes
COMMIT;
```

In case of an error, you can roll back to the previous state:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Perform some operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
-- Simulate an error
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo changes
```

#### Savepoints
Savepoints allow you to create a point within a transaction that you can roll back to without affecting the entire transaction:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;

SAVEPOINT sp1;  -- Create a savepoint

-- Perform operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Rollback to the savepoint if an error occurs
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

COMMIT;
```

#### Usage Scenarios

- **Banking Transactions**: A transaction where money is transferred between two accounts. Both operations must be completed successfully, or neither should be applied (atomicity).
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;

  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

  COMMIT;
  ```

- **Inventory Management**: Inserting a record for an order in the inventory and updating stock counts. Either both operations should succeed, or neither should be applied.
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;

  INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date) VALUES (101, 1, NOW());
  UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE product_id = 101;

  COMMIT;
  ```

- **Database Maintenance**: When performing schema changes or bulk data modifications, you may want to ensure the consistency of the database.
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;

  -- Perform database operations

  COMMIT;  -- Commit if all operations succeed
  ```

#### Conclusion
Transactions are a crucial part of maintaining data integrity, especially in systems with multiple operations that must be treated as a single unit. By understanding and using transactions, savepoints, and isolation levels, you can ensure that your applications remain reliable, consistent, and safe from data corruption.
