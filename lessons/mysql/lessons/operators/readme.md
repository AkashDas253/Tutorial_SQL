### Overview of Operators

Operators in MySQL are used in SQL queries to manipulate values and columns. They can perform calculations, compare values, combine conditions, and more. Operators are typically used in `WHERE` clauses, `SELECT` expressions, `UPDATE` statements, and any other context that requires evaluation or manipulation of data.

### Types of Operators

MySQL supports a wide range of operators, grouped into several categories based on their functionality.

---

#### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

| Operator | Description            | Example                 |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| `+`      | Addition               | `SELECT 2 + 3;`         |
| `-`      | Subtraction            | `SELECT 5 - 3;`         |
| `*`      | Multiplication         | `SELECT 3 * 4;`         |
| `/`      | Division               | `SELECT 10 / 2;`        |
| `%`      | Modulo (Remainder)     | `SELECT 10 % 3;`        |

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT salary + 500 AS updated_salary FROM employees;
```

---

#### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`).

| Operator  | Description                         | Example                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `=`       | Equal to                           | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 30;`   |
| `!=`      | Not equal to                       | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age != 30;`  |
| `<`       | Less than                          | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age < 30;`    |
| `>`       | Greater than                       | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;`    |
| `<=`      | Less than or equal to              | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age <= 30;`   |
| `>=`      | Greater than or equal to           | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= 30;`   |
| `BETWEEN` | Between two values                 | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;` |
| `IN`      | Matches any value in a list        | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age IN (20, 30, 40);` |
| `LIKE`    | Matches a pattern                  | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';` |
| `IS NULL` | Checks for `NULL` values            | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE address IS NULL;` |
| `IS NOT NULL` | Checks for non-`NULL` values    | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE address IS NOT NULL;` |

---

#### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause.

| Operator | Description                  | Example                        |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `AND`    | Both conditions must be true  | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20 AND name = 'John';` |
| `OR`     | At least one condition must be true | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20 OR name = 'John';` |
| `NOT`    | Negates a condition           | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE NOT age > 30;` |

---

#### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used for performing bit-level operations.

| Operator | Description         | Example                      |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `&`      | Bitwise AND         | `SELECT 5 & 3;`              |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR          | `SELECT 5 | 3;`              |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR         | `SELECT 5 ^ 3;`              |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT         | `SELECT ~5;`                 |
| `<<`     | Left shift          | `SELECT 5 << 1;`             |
| `>>`     | Right shift         | `SELECT 5 >> 1;`             |

#### String Operators

String operators are used to manipulate string data.

| Operator   | Description                          | Example                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `CONCAT()` | Concatenates two or more strings     | `SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World');` |
| `LENGTH()` | Returns the length of a string       | `SELECT LENGTH('Hello World');` |
| `SUBSTRING()` | Extracts a substring from a string | `SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5);` |

---

#### Other Operators

Other operators in MySQL serve various purposes.

| Operator | Description                      | Example                         |
|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `DISTINCT` | Returns distinct values          | `SELECT DISTINCT age FROM users;` |
| `EXISTS`   | Checks if a subquery returns any rows | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orders.user_id = users.id);` |
| `ALL`      | Compares a value to all values returned by a subquery | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ALL (SELECT age FROM users WHERE city = 'New York');` |
| `ANY`      | Compares a value to any value returned by a subquery | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ANY (SELECT age FROM users WHERE city = 'New York');` |

### Usage of Operators

Operators in MySQL are used in various SQL statements to perform calculations, comparisons, and data manipulation. Common scenarios include:

1. **Selecting Data Based on Conditions**:
   - Filtering records using comparison and logical operators in `WHERE` clauses.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 30 AND city = 'New York';
   ```

2. **Performing Calculations**:
   - Using arithmetic operators in `SELECT` expressions to calculate totals or averages.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT salary, salary * 12 AS annual_salary FROM employees;
   ```

3. **Modifying Data**:
   - Using operators in `UPDATE` statements to change data values.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.1 WHERE category = 'electronics';
   ```

4. **Checking for NULL**:
   - Using `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` to check for missing values in a column.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone_number IS NULL;
   ```

5. **Pattern Matching**:
   - Using the `LIKE` operator for pattern matching in string columns.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
   ```

6. **String Manipulation**:
   - Using string operators like `CONCAT()` to combine values.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
   ```

Operators in MySQL are powerful tools used for performing calculations, comparisons, logical checks, and data manipulations. By mastering the different types of operators and understanding how to apply them in SQL queries, you can build efficient and effective data management systems.
