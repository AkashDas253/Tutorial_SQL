## Comprehensive Note on Views in MySQL

Views in MySQL are **virtual tables** created by storing SQL queries. They do not hold data themselves but provide a dynamic result set based on the query defined. Views simplify complex queries, enhance security, and support abstraction in databases.

### CREATE VIEW

Creates a new view using a `SELECT` query.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] [ALGORITHM = {UNDEFINED | MERGE | TEMPTABLE}]
VIEW view_name [(column_list)]
AS
SELECT ...
[WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION];
```

- `OR REPLACE`: Replaces an existing view.
- `ALGORITHM`: Defines view creation strategy.
- `CHECK OPTION`: Restricts updates to rows visible in the view.

---

### SELECT from VIEW

A view is queried like a regular table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM view_name;
```

---

### UPDATE/INSERT through VIEW

You can update or insert through a view **only if** it is **updatable** and meets certain constraints (no joins, aggregates, etc.).

**Syntax:**
```sql
UPDATE view_name SET column = value WHERE condition;
INSERT INTO view_name (columns) VALUES (...);
```

---

### REPLACE VIEW

Replaces an existing view without having to drop it manually.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT ...;
```

---

### DROP VIEW

Removes a view.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] view_name;
```

---

### CHECK OPTION

Used in view definitions to **restrict modifications** to only rows the view can "see."

**Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition
WITH CHECK OPTION;
```

- `CASCADED`: Applies to this and all dependent views.
- `LOCAL`: Applies only to the current view.

### Updatable vs Non-Updatable Views

| Property                    | Updatable View                     | Non-Updatable View                    |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Based on single table      | ‚úÖ                                  | ‚ùå (multiple tables or joins)         |
| Contains aggregate/group   | ‚ùå                                  | ‚úÖ                                    |
| Contains subquery/union    | ‚ùå                                  | ‚úÖ                                    |
| Uses `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`| ‚ùå                                  | ‚úÖ                                    |
| Can be INSERTed/UPDATED    | ‚úÖ                                  | ‚ùå                                    |

### Usage Scenarios for Views

- **Abstract complex joins/queries:**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
  SELECT id, name FROM customers WHERE status = 'active';
  ```

- **Enhance security (restrict column access):**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW public_employees AS
  SELECT name, department FROM employees;
  ```

- **Simplify repeated queries:**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW order_summary AS
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
  FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
  ```

- **Customizable data filters per user/role:**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW manager_view AS
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'
  WITH CHECK OPTION;
  ```

### Conclusion

Views in MySQL act as **named queries** and are powerful for simplifying data access, improving security, and abstracting business logic. While not all views are updatable, they remain crucial for structuring clean and maintainable database logic.
