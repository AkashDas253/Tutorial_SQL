## MySQL Overview

### What is MySQL?

MySQL is an **open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)** based on **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. It is developed and maintained by **Oracle Corporation**. MySQL is known for its **speed**, **reliability**, and **ease of use**, and it powers many **web-based applications** like WordPress, Facebook, and Twitter.

### Core Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relational Model** | Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns.               |
| **SQL**              | Standard language used to interact with relational databases.               |
| **Tables**           | Collections of rows (records) and columns (fields).                         |
| **Schemas**          | Namespaces that contain tables, views, procedures, etc.                     |
| **Indexes**          | Improve query performance by optimizing data retrieval.                    |
| **Foreign Keys**     | Enforce referential integrity between tables.                               |
| **Stored Procedures**| Predefined SQL code that can be reused.                                     |
| **Triggers**         | SQL code that executes automatically in response to certain events.         |

### Architecture

| Layer                | Components                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Client Layer**     | Handles client communication using protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, named pipes). |
| **SQL Layer**        | Parser, Optimizer, Query Cache, and Execution Engine.                      |
| **Storage Engine**   | Manages how data is stored. InnoDB (default), MyISAM, Memory, etc.         |
| **File System Layer**| Interfaces with OS to read/write actual data files.                        |
